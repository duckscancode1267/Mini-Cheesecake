Get a bowl and mix half a block of cream chese, and two tablespoons of sugar. Add a pinch of vanilla extract and mix.
After it is well blended, get a seperate small bowl and put in a little bit of butter in the bottom and cover it with crushed cookie.
Flatten out the butter and pour in the cream cheese mix. Microwave for one minute and set to cool.
Microwave for another minute and then place in freezer until it cools down completely. This may take up to half an hour, or you can eat it warm if you want.
